v1.1.0 (planned)
* Support for unequal allocation (the probability of allocation to treatment and control are not 50-50)
* Support for inverting randomization tests to create nonparametric confidence intervals
* Support for KK regression estimators (that use a linear combination of matches and reservoir estimators)
* Support for the count response with censoring

v1.0.0
* Support for many other response types: 
  + incidence - uses logistic regression via glm to compute weights and the regression estimator
  + proportion - uses beta regression via betareg::betareg to compute weights and the regression estimator
  + count (uncensored) - uses negative binomial regression via MASS::glm.nb to compute weights and the regression estimator
  + survival (censored and uncensored) - uses the Weibull model via survival::survreg to compute weights and the regression estimator 
* Weights in KK21 designs now are computed from absolute test statistic values (in v0.1.0 it was based on Rsq which does not generalize to the other response types)
* Support for adding responses whenever they become recorded
* Support for general data frames which include factors, characters, logical data types 
* No need to declare factors' levels from the getgo
* Support for missing data imputed via the missRanger package
* p does not need to be declared when initializing a design (but n is required still)
* Support for additional parameter estimation / estimator by response types:
  + continuous
    - for KK designs only: additive treatment effect / OLS with covariates and dummies for reservoir and pairs
    - for KK designs only: additive treatment effect / OLS with covariates and random effects for reservoir and pairs
  + incidence
    - probability difference / simple difference in means
    - additive effect on log odds of probability of positive outcome / logistic regression estimate without covariates
    - additive effect on log odds of probability of positive outcome / logistic regression estimate with covariates linear in log odds
    - for KK designs only: additive effect on log odds of probability of positive outcome / OLS with covariates and dummies for reservoir and pairs
    - for KK designs only: additive effect on log odds of probability of positive outcome / OLS with with covariates linear in log odds and random effects for reservoir and pairs
  + proportion
    - expected proportion difference / simple difference in means
    - additive effect on log odds of expected proportion / beta regression estimate without covariates
    - additive effect on log odds of expected proportion / beta regression estimate with covariates linear in log odds    
    - for KK designs only: additive effect on log odds of proportion / beta regression estimate with covariates and dummies for reservoir and pairs
  + count
    - expected mean difference / simple difference in means
    - additive effect on log expected mean difference / negative binomial regression estimate without covariates
    - additive effect on log expected mean difference / negative binomial regression estimate with covariates linear in log odds    
    - for KK designs only: additive effect on log expected mean difference / negative binomial regression estimate with covariates linear in log odds and random effects for reservoir and pairs
    - for KK designs only: additive effect on log expected mean difference / negative binomial regression estimate with covariates linear in log odds and random effects for reservoir and pairs
  + survival
    - expected median difference / difference of Kaplan-Meier median estimators which uses the controlTest package to compute its sample std error
    - additive effect on log mean survival / Weibull regression estimate without covariates
    - additive effect on log mean survival / Weibull regression estimate with covariates linear in log mean
    
v0.1.0

* Support for designs CRD, BCRD, Atkinson, KK14, KK21, KK21stepwise 
* Support for the following parameter estimation / via estimator:
    - additive treatment effect / simple difference of sample means
    - additive treatment effect / OLS estimator with covariates
    - for KK designs only: additive treatment effect / combined simple difference in means for reservoir and pairs
    - for KK designs only: additive treatment effect / combined OLS for reservoir and pairs
