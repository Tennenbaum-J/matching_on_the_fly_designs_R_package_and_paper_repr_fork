v1.1.0 (planned)
* Support for unequal allocation (the probability of allocation to treatment and control are not 50-50)
* Support for KK regression estimators (that use a linear combination of matches and reservoir estimators)
* Support for inverting randomization tests to create nonparametric confidence intervals

v1.0.0
* Support for many other response types: 
  + incidence - uses logistic regression via glm to compute weights and the regression estimator
  + proportion - uses beta regression via betareg::betareg to compute weights and the regression estimator
  + count (uncensored) - uses negative binomial regression via MASS::glm.nb to compute weights and the regression estimator
  + survival (censored and uncensored) - uses the Weibull model via survival::survreg to compute weights and the regression estimator also
    uses Kaplan-Meier to compute an additional estimator: the difference in medians and uses the controlTest package to compute its sample std error
* Weights in KK21 designs now are computed from absolute test statistic values (to generalize across the other response types)
* Support for adding responses whenever they become recorded
* Support for general data frames which include factors, characters, logical data types 
* No need to declare factors' levels from the getgo
* Support for missing data imputed via the missRanger package
* p does not need to be declared when initializing a design (but n is required still)

v0.1.0
* Initial Release with support for continuous response type and equal allocation (50-50 treatment/control) only
