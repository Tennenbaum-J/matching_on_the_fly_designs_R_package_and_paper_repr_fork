v1.1.0 (planned)
* Support for unequal allocation (the probability of allocation to treatment and control are not 50-50)
* Support for inverting randomization tests to create nonparametric confidence intervals
* Support for KK simple and regression estimators (that use a linear combination of matches and reservoir estimators) for incidence, count, proportion and survival response types for equal and unequal allocation experiments
* Support for the count response with censoring
* Support for Aalen additive regression model for censored data

v1.0.0
* Support for general response types: 
  + incidence - uses logistic regression via glm to compute weights and perform inference
  + proportion - uses beta regression via betareg::betareg to compute weights and perform inference
  + count (uncensored) - uses negative binomial regression via MASS::glm.nb to compute weights and perform inference
  + survival (censored and uncensored) - uses the median difference via Kaplan-Meier, the Weibull model and the coxph model via the survival package to compute weights and perform inference 
* Weights in KK21 designs now are computed from absolute test statistic values (in v0.1.0 it was based on Rsq which does not generalize to the other response types)
* Support for adding responses whenever they become recorded
* Support for general data frames which include factors, characters, logical data types 
* p does not need to be declared when initializing a design (but n is required still)
* No need to declare factors' levels from the getgo
* Support for missing data imputed via the missRanger and missForest packages
* Support for different feature sets for each subject due to this imputation support
* Additional inference support for parameter / estimator by response types:
  + continuous
