#' A completely randomized / Bernoulli Sequential Design
#' 
#' @description
#' An R6 Class encapsulating the data and functionality for a sequential experimental design.
#' This class takes care of data intialization and sequential assignments. The class object
#' should be saved securely after each assignment e.g. on an encrypted cloud server.

		#' @description
		#' Initialize a completely randomized sequential experimental design
		#'
		#' @param response_type 	The data type of response values which must be one of the following: 
		#' 							"continuous"(the default),  
		#' 							"incidence", 
		#' 							"proportion", 
		#' 							"count", 
		#' 							"survival".
		#' 							This package will enforce that all added responses via the \code{add_subject_response} method will be
		#' 							of the appropriate type.
		#' @param prob_T	The probability of the treatment assignment. This defaults to \code{0.5}.
		#' @param include_is_missing_as_a_new_feature	If missing data is present in a variable, should we include another dummy variable for its
		#' 												missingness in addition to imputing its value? If the feature is type factor, instead of creating
		#' 												a new column, we allow missingness to be its own level. The default is \code{TRUE}.
		#' @param n			The sample size (if fixed). Default is \code{NULL} for not fixed.
		#' @param verbose	A flag indicating whether messages should be displayed to the user. Default is \code{TRUE}.
		#' @param thin		For internal use only. Do not specify. You can thank R6's single constructor-only for this coding noise.
		#' @return 			A new `SeqDesignCRD` object

		#' @examples
		#' seq_des = SeqDesignCRD$new(response_type = "continuous")
