Title: Sequential Experimental Design via Matching on-the-Fly with Estimation and Testing
Version: 0.1.0
Author: Adam Kapelner and Abba Krieger
Maintainer: Adam Kapelner <kapelner@qc.cuny.edu>
Description: Generates the following sequential two-arm experimental designs:
    (1) completely randomized (Bernoulli)
    (2) balanced completely randomized
    (3) Efron's (1971) Biased Coin
    (4) Atkinson's (1982) Covariate-Adjusted Biased Coin
    (5) Kapelner and Krieger's (2014) Covariate-Adjusted Matching on the Fly
    (6) Kapelner and Krieger's (2021) CARA Matching on the Fly with Differential Covariate Weights
    (7) Kapelner and Krieger's (2021) CARA Matching on the Fly with Differential Covariate Weights (Stepwise)
    and also provides the following types of inference:
    (1) estimation (with both Z-style estimators and OLS estimators), 
    (2) frequentist testing (via asymptotic distribution results and via employing the nonparameteric randomization test) and
    (3) frequentist confidence intervals (only under the superpopulation sampling assumption currently).
